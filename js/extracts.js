To get to Night\'s domain, Aaru must travel through the Day and Dusk domains before reaching Night. By going out of his own environment and to other domains Aaru is taking a great risk of disturbing the balance of Lumenox.

He can also break specific walls by charging into them. The second ability is teleporting. Aaru can shoot an orb anywhere he wants and afterwards the player can teleport Aaru to the orbs location.\r\nWith these two abilities the player needs to control Aaru and complete the levels within the domains.

Using sensor-based peripherals that work with your smartphone or smart glass, LyteShot takes gaming out of the living room and brings it into the real world. The LyteShot platform consists of the Lyter handheld device, the LytePuck receiver, which is worn by each player and, if desired, the player\'s choice of peripherals: the LyteGun, LyteWand, LyteDagger and many more.  The Lyter handheld device and LytePuck sensor connect with your mobile device to transmit game data to other players via the cloud. Depending on the game, the LyteShot system can, for example, send a virtual antidote to a poisoned comrade, deliver a deadly blow to an enemy, or locate a key to unlock a virtual treasure. Through the pull of a trigger, the Lyter sends out a beam to the LytePuck that carries commands to trigger any of these responses (and so many more). Once the LytePuck receives a command, it reacts by lighting up or vibrating, alerting the player who is wearing the LytePuck to the in-game response. This command also gets sent instantaneously through the cloud to all the players\' mobile devices so everyone gets the most up to date game stats, messages, and any other type of real time information.\r\n\r\nAssassin: The Game\r\nWith the launch of the platform, LyteShot proudly presents its first game of many called Assassin: The Game. To play, you organize a game right from your smartphone. The first thing you do is set up your unique game rules. For example, you can set the game timeframe, geo-boundaries, special functions to make the game more complex like respawning, late entry, cool-down clock, penalties, and more. You also have the option to make your game public and allow anyone in the area to join. Once your invited friends accept their invites, you hit the play button on your smartphone and receive your target\'s dossier with a mugshot. Your mission is to find and eliminate this target by finding the target and igniting their LytePuck with your Lyter. Your challenge is to do this before your Assassin finds and eliminates you. Paranoia will escalate quickly in this game since the identity of your Assassin is unknown and has the ability to take you out with a long range hit, or score more points with a close proximity hit. Once you find and eliminate your target, the LyteShot app system will automatically update the game status and you will immediately be given your next target from the players left remaining in the game. The game ends when the last Assassin eliminates their last target.

Barbetween takes its theme and its name from \"Between the Bars\" by Elliott Smith.\r\n\r\nWhile Seltani is themed around the Myst universe, Barbetween, which takes perhaps 15 minutes to play through, requires no particular knowledge of or familiarity with Myst. Barony is a 3D, first-person RPG featuring cooperative multiplayer, dungeon-crawling mechanics, roguelike elements, and real-time action. The goal of the game is to destroy an undead lich named Baron Herx, who terrorized the world above in a previous life and is now holding out in a vast subterranean complex known as the Devil\'s Bastion. The game fully supports cooperative multiplayer for up to four players, meaning you can experience this adventure by yourself or with a few friends over LAN or the internet. From indie game developer JABB INTERACTIVE, comes the new addictive iOS game, BasketWars, launching late 2014.  BasketWars is an action-packed basketball game based on the famous battles of World War II.  Use your soldier to launch the balls up in the air and into the basket.  These are no ordinary balls though, these balls have some serious firepower.  Each amazingly designed WWII influenced ball has a unique weapon to help you defeat the enemy and make the perfect shot. This isn\'t as easy as it sounds.  You will be armed with a few balls to make one amazing shot that will destroy all the enemy forces.  You will have to time your shots perfectly as an onslaught of grenades, missiles, and bullets are hurled towards you with bad intent.  Once you have managed to conquer the progressively difficult battles, you will then meet the Bosses.  Armed with guns, grenades, and missiles, getting past each boss will be nearly impossible.  With over 60 masterfully designed levels, and 6 insane Bosses, and nastalgic bonus levels, BasketWars is a true test of strength and skill.  Play alone or challenge your friends to a battle of epic proportion.  Do you have what it takes to win the war?  Hoo-rah! A simple but puzzling platformer that designs its stages around an alternative to the traditional \"speed-run\" level design concept. In place of speed running is a \"jump par\", literally a minimum number of jumps that a stage can be completed in. This par is made more complex by the protagonist\'s constant automatic jumping mechanic. BeatBox is a survival game for 1 to 4 players. Gameplay takes place atop a neon-lit cube which flips and turns in time with a thumping electronic soundtrack which is generated randomly as the game is played. Each flip changes the color of the cube, triggering different enemy types associated with each color to appear and attempt to push the players off. Knocking enemies and other players off of the cube will earn the players points, as will surviving through consecutive flips. The action speeds up as the game goes on, challenging players to keep up. Special events may cause the cube to change shape, gain extra spinning force, or a scattering of power-ups or floating platforms to appear. Players can compete for a high score, aim to be the last one standing, or work together to see how long they can survive as a team.\r\n GREAT ARTIST is a chaotic paint program, where each key on the keyboard does a different unhelpful thing.

Day & Night is an innovative and uncommon memory game utilizing spacial and temporal skills. Day & Night features simplistic graphics style and each level consists of two phases, a day phase and a night phase. During the day mosquitos follow very interesting paths (VIPs) and you are supposed to remember those trails. During the night VIP mosquitos will fly again along the same trails, but in addition there is a number of enemy mosquitos flying around, too. The task is simple: kill all the enemies without harming VIPs. For this task there are different tools to be used which differ from level to level. For example, there are lamps which burn all the mosquitos in its influence area. Then there are frogs which will greedy swallow each mosquito which comes too close to their tongues. This simple principle is a receipt for many different gameplay settings.\r\n\r\n Level selection is done in an innovative way: each level corresponds to a day in a calendar overview. This was inspired by real physical riddle calenders, where you have to solve one task per day. D&N is currently still in development and at the moment 45 levels are playable. Roland Studios is an independent video game developer currently working on a 2d Platformer entitled \"Daydreamer.\" The story is a little ambiguous to explain, but here goes. To sum up, it\'s about a young girl, Olivia, waking up in a post-apocalyptic era.\r\n\r\nOlivia awakens from a human preservation chamber on her home planet which was taken over by aliens thousands of years ago. She wakes up to find a barren world stripped of its resources in the midst of civil war. The world has become over-populated by its new alien inhabitants. As a result, the aliens have turned against the gods that they had once served. The world is in shambles from radioactive war, genetically mutated aliens, and giant bugs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as the world struggles, Olivia is in a deep sleep. She has a dream in which she is confronted by one of the aliens who tells her that she must seek out her brother. Soon after she awakens, the game begins. \u2013Oh yeah, and she also has super psychic powers!\r\n\r\nThe game plays like a conventional side scrolling shooter, greatly inspired by Megaman and older Treasure Games, i.e. Gun-star Heroes\/Alien Soldiers, from the 16 bit era. Aside from platforming and shooting, the game also has \"Spirit Animals\" support character mercenaries that give the player a tactical edge amongst all the chaos. The game is very Boss Focused, although it includes a vast interconnected world for exploration, dare I say Metroidmania.\r\n\r\nThe look of the game is primarily pre-rendered cgi sprites. Since the dawn of the N64, the law of the land has always been \"everything 3d\". Everything had to be \"a connected all in one immersive experience,\" a common buzzword that has been used to death. I miss games that were just an \"awesome experience\". I have always admired the graphical fidelity of titles like Donkey Kong Country and Final Fantasy VII. Admittedly they look dated in hindsight, but the details are what made it work. When thinking about a graphical style for the game, I always wondered what games would have looked like had developers continue this route. Today most platformers are either Puppet Rigged Graphics, Pixel Art Throwbacks, or have real time DirectX\/OpenGL 3d rendering. All of them have their own inherent beauty, but that being said, I believe that we live in a day and age when most computer processing can handle HD sprites, and there are many possibilities that we have yet to explore. This is cooperative tower-defence. You and a band of survivors find yourselves on the run from a rampaging enemy hellbent on slaughtering everything that breathes. You must work together using anything you can scavenge to fortify your stronghold before night falls. \r\n\r\nWaiting for you is a death so terrible you\'ll do anything to be the last to go. How defensible is this place? Should you stay and fight or move on? How long will our food last? Who can you trust? Is John stealing rations? All of these thoughts race through your mind as you watch and wait. They\'re coming and there\'s no more time for doubt. It\'s do or die.\r\n\r\nDead Cells places you in a hostile zombie filled universe with limited resources and no chance of surviving alone. You\'ll have to work together to cheat death for another night, but ultimately you must confront your doom. The aim of the game is to survive for as long as possible while ultimately trying to be the last one alive... \"Dead Synchronicity: Tomorrow comes Today\" is a point and click 2D graphic adventure game, featuring space-time distortions, a dystopian atmosphere... and a dark, bloodstained plot.\r\n\r\nA terrible pandemic is turning all of humanity into \"The Dissolved\": the sick whose deliria provide them with supernatural cognitive powers... but also steer them towards a gruesome death. The \"Great Wave,\" an inexplicable chain of natural disasters that destroyed all energy sources and plunged the world into a chaos ruthlessly controlled by the army\u2026 seems to be the root of this illness.\r\n\r\nHelp Michael, a man with no past, recover his identity and decode the events that brought the world to the edge of collapse.

Loosely based on the true story of Egypt\'s secret missile program in the 1960s and the Mossad spies who infiltrated and eliminated those behind it. Deception presents an espionage experience that emphasizes story and player choice amidst a paranoid, morally ambiguous world. An adventure game at heart, death and violence are not treated lightly and come with grave consequences as the issues of pre-emptive responses to threats are explored. Deception focuses on the elements of being a spy that are often neglected in games; gamble in European casinos, get information out of femme fatales, and infiltrate the highest echelons of power without needing to pull a trigger.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the ambitions of this game are to tackle very relevant issues in a realistic and honest manner. We hope to illustrate how difficult it can be to do the right thing and produce the intended results in the world of espionage in the Middle East. Deception chronicles the events that led to the Six-Day War which saw Israel capture the Gaza strip from Egypt, the results of which are still very much felt today. DEEP is a meditative and psychoactive game unlike anything you have ever played. Controlled by deep breathing and with a focus on relaxation and exploration, this immersive experience uses a custom diaphragm controller in conjunction with a VR headset. As you breath in and out, your world will shift and react. Take a deeper breath and you with lifted off the ocean floor. Allow DEEP to carry you on undersea currents to seek ancient gods and strange creatures. Let your breath buoy you to fly beneath the waves. A zen-paced arcade game dazzling with phosphorescent beauty, Deep Under the Sky lets you experience life as a strange jellyfish on a remarkable world. Learn to fly through the skies of the psychedelic dark side of Venus. Explore, uncover its secrets, and flourish. The Game\r\nThe game is a classic style first person dungeon crawler, where you form a party of adventurers and go into a dungeon, fighting monsters, solving puzzles, collecting equipment and treasure, and learning the the dungeons secrets.\r\n\r\nThe Setting\r\nThe setting of the game is a medieval fantasy world full of strange races like vegetable people, land dolphins, yetis and others. \r\n\r\nThe Story\r\nThere was a gnome who\'s dream was to make a pretend dungeon that could be enjoyed by all. Eventually the place went out of business, and overtime it slowly became an actual dungeon.  The player forms a party to enter the dungeon and find out what happened to the place. When you go in, it still has all of the typical information signs you would find in a theme park, and it\'s questionable how much of what you are seeing is part of the original attraction or a real dungeon. As you go through the dungeon you find notes from the dungeon master\'s journal telling his story about how he went from creating his dream dungeon to becoming obsessed and losing everything he had. Delver is a 3d first person roguelike action dungeon crawler. The goal of this project was to bring the gameplay from games like Rogue and Nethack from ASCII characters to 3D and first person with the nefarious secret goal of hopefully bringing in a whole generation of new players and getting them interested in the genre. Desert Golfing in an infinite procedurally generated golf game that takes place in a procedurally generated infinite desert.\r\n You want to hear a joke? Universal peace. I mean, why settle for serenity when you can unleash an arsenal of high-powered warheads and destroy every planetary system in the universe? Take that, faraway civilizations!\r\n\r\nDestructamundo is a game of chain reactions and massive explosions. Set off a warhead and watch the fireworks as you cause as much widespread damage as possible by setting off long, winding combos that reach throughout the cosmos. Destroy an entire planetary system in a single shot (or, if you\'re not so cunning, destroy it in a couple of shots). Why would you do such a horrible thing, you might ask? For shiny gold medals, of course! Well, and the survival of your species, but that\'s decidedly less important. Detective Grimoire has been called to investigate a murder. The owner of a small tourist attraction, found deep within the heart of the marshes, seemingly killed by the very mythical creature his attraction is based around... Explore the surrounding area, inspect the scene of the crime, grill the suspects, solve puzzles, search for clues and uncover the secret of the swamp!  You could easily mistake Devil\'s Dare as just another multiplayer 2D arcade zombie beat\'em up, but that\'s not true.\r\n\r\nDevil\'s Dare is bloody a smash up parody of everything from the 90s, pitting the manliest video game heroes against the badest monsters from your favorite horror movies. It\'s the final result of what would happen if everyone from that decade came together to create a baby, a baby that just so happens to grow up to be a beat\'em up. \r\n\r\nPieced together with blood, souls and pixels, Devil\'s Dare brings the beat\'em up back to it\'s very roots. Unlike modern beat\'em up like Castle Crashers or Double Dragon, Devil\'s Dare drops all the grinding and leveling up, and introduce permadeath to keep players on their toes. With every kill, the player make some cash, which he can use to purchase upgrades or save it for revive when he\'s dead. When ran out of cash completely, he\'s dead for good, and it\'s time to start over again. This mechanic was inspired by the good old arcade days, where every death meant another penny wasted!  Devouring Stars is a game where galaxy-sized gods eat starfields to fight an endless war. It\'s a strategy game inspired by greek mythology and tragedy, with Dan Simmons googles (so to speak). \r\n\r\nIn Devouring Stars the player seems to be in charge of his destiny. He is able to define what will happen to him, what enemies he will have to fight against. But that freedom is really a trompe l\'oeil, in the end the player is just entrapped in a complex maze, one that is redesigned at every step along the way.  Dex is a 2D, side-scrolling, open-world cyberpunk RPG with a focus on exploration and non-linear gameplay. Distance is a survival racing game for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Swimming her way through the half-sentient goop, Marta\'s job is to clear the blockage, retrieve any lost items, and make it through the maze of pipes in one piece! It\'s no mistake well known game designers like Jane MacGonigal mention DragonBox games as an example of a great learning game, with some articles seeing DragonBox mentioned alongside Minecraft and Portal. Video games have the power to transform the way we learn, and we\'re not talking incremental improvement here, but learning 10 to 20 faster, with a much higher success rate than with traditional methods. Such is the potential of a well-designed learning game!\r\n\r\n By playing the 100+ puzzles in DragonBox Elements, kids (and adults, too) will gain a deep understanding of the logic of geometry. Through entertaining exploration and discovery, players use shapes and their properties to actually recreate the mathematical proofs that define geometry!

Duel is the competitive mode where each competitor tries to destroy the other player by using the unique abilities and characteristics of their ship. Defend is the endless cooperative mode where two people work together to try and keep as few enemy ships from entering the sacred space between them.\r\n Dual Blast is a versus shooting game. By creating a 2 player game on one machine, we wanted to try to reproduce the atmosphere which emanate from old arcade tables which were common in the 70\'s and the 80\'s. Hopefully it might bring the same kind of fun and craziness to mobile devices.\r\n\r\nDual Blast adopted a 16-bit aesthetic and pursued simplicity, but allows various attack combinations to shoot down your opponent. For that purpose, we had to create a simple, but unique interface to use just one button to move, charge and shoot. This game is a hybrid between a fighting and a shooting game. It combines vintage graphics with innovative interactions. Duck Game is a 2-4 player local deathmatch platformer. It features fast platforming and one shot kills, making rounds short and weapons dangerous.

Duskers is a survival horror RTS set in space. You pilot a team of drones into derelict spaceships via a command line interface, trying to find the means to survive and piece together how the universe became a giant graveyard. In film terms it\'s The Road meets the first Alien movie. In game terms: It\'s a rougelike with elements of dungeon crawling and real time strategy, but in a survival horror setting that focuses on subterfuge, and adapting to survive.\r\n\r\nWhen I created Duskers it was really around a feeling: of being alone in the dark, of  isolation,  of being surrounded by old gritty tech that could only give you  a partial picture about what\'s going on around you, like the motion sensor that goes off, but doesn\'t tell you exactly what\'s out there. I like the idea of needing to rely on that tech, and the claustrophobia and isolation that would cause.  Dusty Revenge Co Op Edition is a 2D action platformer with a unique combat support game mechanic.

At the core of the game, players slide arrows to create a path for two robots to reach one another and fall in love. It\'s easy enough that anyone can play, but the layers of environmental mechanics - such as magnets, conveyor belts, security-bots, etc. - create lots of opportunities for us to tickle the player\'s brain.\r\n\r\nWe wanted a story that was intimate rather than epic, but told in short snippets. It focuses on many of the na\u00EFve, silly, and embarrassing events that can happen during a first relationship. But it also deals with some of the struggles that a young couple might face when their relationship is not accepted by the larger powers that be.  It was very important for us to create an inclusive experience. Particular care was spent to make sure that the robot protagonists were cute, but ambiguous in gender and racial cues. Likewise, we provide a variety of preferred pronouns for the robots so that the love story can be relatable to an audience that is often underserved.\r\n After the fall of Albatropolis, General Puff and the Budgie Commandos have set up residence in the old hotel and are getting themselves organized!

By taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym of that synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other word in the English language. More languages forthcoming, including the ability to switch mid-game between languages; i.e. you might be given a French goal word but a Japanese start word and use Mandarin to get there quickest.  \r\n\r\nThe game supports multiplayer, and weekly challenges in which users can compete globally on set start and end words. Every time a path is uncovered by a user, it is tweeted from @synonymygame and posted to our Facebook page. 100 percent of profits go to educational\/literary charities. \r\n\r\nSynonymy is the first game by filmmaker Christopher Cinq-Mars Jarvis and is narrated by world-renowned author and biologist, Richard Dawkins. \r\n\r\nA visualization of the game\'s network can be seen here -- http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/med6g8b -- In order to compute relative distance, all synonyms were mapped using 3d graphing software, as if each word were a planet that had a gravitational pull proportional to its number of relationships to other nodes.

I like to think that cooperation is key to evolution. A big part of me wishes that art, or entertainment, would be the same.

Realizing that people are no longer happy with being just the consumer, Tetrageddon aims to satisfy the need to play, create, adapt, copy & paste, and build on.\r\n\r\nTetrageddon Games is a satire of our digital life.

It is the internet in the form of a game, as if your browser landed in the web\'s version of Ripley\'s Believe It or Not!. It is full of rabbit holes, and waves of bizarre creations that you play with.\r\nI encourage the player to interact with the project as a whole (holistically). It is not only separate individual pieces, but a narration of the dynamic times we are in. Tetrobot and Co. is a pure puzzle game, created for players looking to give their mind a workout.

Set in a decaying city from a civilization long past, The Old City: Leviathan puts the player in the shoes of a sewer dwelling isolationist.

The story of The Old City: Leviathan is not told in a traditional manner. As you progress through the narrative, you will overhear a conversation between two entities.

A typically intense Midwestern storm is approaching while Kelly is out; she needs to get home. \r\n\r\nIn Three Fourths Home, players assume the role of Kelly while she is driving home during this thunderstorm. The focus of the game is its narrative, conveyed through an extended conversation Kelly has with her parents and younger brother.

CrakHed\'s mind also bore Thumper, the ultimate space beetle.  With a natural resistance to his creator\'s corruption, Thumper is a being of moderation and restraint.

It is something a little different and quirky from your average dungeon crawler.\r\n\r\nTo escape the keep, players must master the dynamic and often frantic physics-based combat, make use of the environment by luring monsters into traps, and battle hordes of deadly enemies. Fire torches and braziers can be knocked over to set the ground on fire, and prisoners can be released to help players on their way. Enemies exhibit emergent behaviour and will work together to hunt the player down, whilst others will flee from threats. Players can take advantage of monster rivalries and lead them against each other, watching from a distance as the resulting chaos ensues. There are many ways to survive in TinyKeep.\r\n\r\nAll levels are procedurally generated, and there are over 30 different monsters and bosses spread across 4 different environments. To add to the crazy mix, gold can be sacrificed in return for random buffs. These perks offer all sorts of benefits, from giving extra health or speed, to more game changing abilities such as the power to slow down time. The game is also filled with a ton of secrets, such as a flaming sword that sets enemies on fire, or an endgame weapon that explodes on impact. There\'s also 3 different endings to discover. Finally there is a fire breathing Baby Dragon pet, hidden in a secret location for the most dedicated players to find.\r\n\r\nTinyKeep\'s mechanics and variety of content may appear to be simple of the surface, but dig a little deeper and you\'ll find many layers of subtlety, secrets and charm. Between our world and the world beyond lie the Titan Souls, the spiritual source and sum of all living things. Now scattered amongst the ruins and guarded by the idle titans charged with their care, a solitary human armed with but a single arrow is once again assembling shards of the Titan Soul in a quest for truth and power. WHAT\'S UNIQUE ABOUT TITANS\r\nTitans is a uniquely original Role Playing Card Game (\"RPCG\") that redefines the category for the midcore gamer.  The game offers depth in strategy, content, and gameplay yet its simplistically intuitive.  The UI is very carefully constructed to enable deep social interactions with other players (cooperative and competitive) and with the ever expanding world.  The game concept is novel and drives the incredibly detailed backstory which is often an afterthought in mobile games today.  Most importantly, it\'s a highly engaging type of fun!\r\n\r\nSTORY\r\nThe Titans adventure takes place in the Kingdom of Maharal, the mightiest kingdom in the Realms. Maharal\'s ascent to power was fuelled by the discoveries of the Order, a group of scholars devoted to the study of the natural world and its mysteries. The Order was responsible for the discovery of Alchemy, a mystical art that gave man the power to transform inanimate matter into living beings. The Alchemists\' greatest creations were the Titans - large, powerful creatures that were crafted from the elements of nature and protected the Kingdom from its enemies. \r\n\r\nMaharal enjoys the friendship and allegiance of many other Kingdoms that comprise the Realms, but there are those that covet its power and status - and none are more feared than the Kingdom of Ghalos. An older Kingdom forged from the steel of battle, Ghalos has always sought to expand its influence through conquest and violence. Its leader, the tyrant King Malachaim, has conspired to invade Marahal and claim the secrets of Alchemy as his own. He has led his soldiers across the Pyrgos Sea to the shores of Maharal, and he now sits on the throne of Chalcedon while his armies raze the lands, their forces strengthened by the Titans they have captured from the Order.\r\n\r\nIn Titans, you play the role of an Alchemist who has escaped capture during the invasion; you must use your talents to craft an army of Titans strong enough to defeat Malachaim and restore peace to the Kingdom.  And so your journey begins\u2026\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS\r\nAs you journey across the Kingdom of Maharal, you will encounter allies that pledge their talents to your cause. Jeryn, a young Initiate of the Order who escaped from the Ghalians, guides you to the safety of the Cerelian Forests and along the first steps of your adventure. Rhea of Mavior, a Master Alchemist of unsurpassed skill, can create any Titan or Elixir you will need as you fight the Ghalian forces. Other allies of the Order, like the mysterious Smuggler, will lend a hand in your struggle - for a price.\r\n\r\nThe forces of Ghalos, led by the vicious and bloodthirsty Malachaim, will test your resolve and courage at every turn. You and your Titans must prove to be the equal of the Ghalian armies; you must find a way to reclaim the city of Chalcedon and the Order\'s Tower, so that King Eitan can return to his throne and peace can be restored.\r\n\r\nYour fate is now forever tied to the fate of the kingdom - but fate has taken a great interest in your adventure, Alchemist. The Watcher, keeper of the secrets of reality, will reveal herself to you, and to you only she will reveal a great mystery: there are an infinite number of Realms, each with another Alchemist who fights the same battle as you, and you will have the power to call on each other for help to realize your shared fates\u2026\r\n\r\nTHE DETAILS\r\n- Collect and craft over 150 unique Titans\r\n- Complete 80 Quests across Maharal\r\n- Engage in Rotating Daily Events and Weekly Special Events\r\n- Compete in Realtime PvP with other Alchemists in 2 modes: War and Conquest\r\n- Meaningful in app purchases for premium Titans and Items for paying players\r\n- 12 Localizations: French, German, Chinese (Traditional & Simplified), Korean, Japanese, Italian, Russian, Spanish (Latin American), Turkish, Portuguese (Brazil), Arabic\r\n- New Materials, Titans, and Quests will be added each month\r\n An appetising arena shoot-em-up garnished with tower-defence elements and served warm with awesome-sauce (probably syrup). \r\n\r\nInter-dimensional time-blob beasties have sailed the cosmos in pursuit of spare time, and now they\'ve found it, tasted it, on an idyllic Monday morning. \r\n\r\nAssume the role of TERRY (toast-ejecting recoil & reload system), a humble and solitary toaster with an uncontrollable love for English breakfasts, hats and scheduling. \r\n\r\nTap to launch toast, crumpets and magnitudes of other breakfast paraphernalia at the beasties.

Recipe for Tower of Guns: A randomized FPS+Bullethell+Roguelite Mashup.\r\n\r\nIngredients:\r\n-7 Randomized levels filled with really crazy rooms\r\n-19 very weird guns (set aside half to be found only in secret places)\r\n-12 perks, unlockable\r\n-Assortment of secret rooms and levels, to taste.\r\n-1 cornucopia of strange randomized plots, be sure to include secret-agent canines\r\n-382,109 bullets, sawblades, energy beams, lasers, bombs, grenades, and other things that want to kill you\r\n\r\nStep 1: Put on Kid Goggles. Tower of Guns was designed with the lens of \"what game would an 8 year old make?\". The result is very crazy. It doesn\'t matter WHY something has spikes, only that it has ALL the spikes.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Start Game, get into the role. Are you a Jelly-monster searching for the truth? Are you a vacation-bound mouse trying to get his driver\'s license? Are you a grandma searching for a recycling center? Did you turn off the story entirely in the options? I don\'t blame you.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Play Game: Avoid Spikes. Liberally hit fire button. Optionally shoot hugbots.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Fold in several hundred flying sawblades, homing suicide bots, torrents of bullets, bouncing cauldrons of doom, airships, tanks, turrets, and about thirty other lethal contraptions.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Upgrade that rocket launcher with a rapid-fire modifier. Upgrade yourself with a hundred double jumps. Tower of Guns encourages hopping all over the place like an over-caffeinated frog. There\'s even a secret game mode where touching the ground hurts you. \r\n\r\nStep 6: Stir in one boss per level. Is it Mama-spinbot, matron of death? Is it Dr. Turret, the Tower of Guns within the Tower of Guns (...woah...)? Is it the Egg Scrambler, a gauntlet of mincers built to puree skyscrapers?\r\n\r\nStep 7: Die. Celebrate the craziness or curse the developer, to taste. Repeat Steps 1-6.\r\n\r\nServes 1. Best served with mashed potatoes.

A former AAA game industry veteran, James left his job so that he could pursue his artistic ambitions. The first result of this is ULTRAWORLD: a work intended to help define video games as an artistic medium. Yes, that sounds pretentious, but hey, don\'t walk away just yet.  ULTRAWORLD\'s story was written in a way that could only exist in this format, and none other.  This could never be a book, a movie, or a play; it could only be a video game.  Some people may not classify ULTRAWORLD as such, especially those who cling to the word \"game\" in the literal sense.  What\'s more important, though, a label, or the finished work?  Wherever it lands, as long as the viewer gets something worthwhile out of it, then it doesn\'t matter.

You, a Very Meaningful Game is a wonderfully pretentious game about the most important thing in the world \u2013 You.  Each level of the game is about problem solving a space for You to meet objectives while making sense of the in-game content. Using the player character You, the player is both making meaning out of nonsense and finding meaning where it is absent.   The game is designed as a light-hearted critical reflection on the intersection of narratology and ludology, or more simply -  ludic, intellectual fondling of words and meaning. \r\n\r\nPlayers must play with You, I and Them in the immutable structure of meaning making that forms the challenge of the game. The game provides an endless pursuit of intellectual meaning, or you could simply play, except it for what it is, and understand that even with meaning the game is yet another platformer with a thinly draped layer of meaning. It is the 10th game in the Critical Gameplay collection, a 4 year indie project to offer alternative ways to play. Other games included a 30\" Teddy Bear as controller (Big Huggin\'), a game about waiting for things to happen (Wait), a game about unshooting people (Healer), an FPS that forces you to review the life of every soldier you killed (Bang!) and a couple of games about racism and stereotype.  \r\n Zero-G is a hard core old school futuristic sports game taking place in zero gravity.

This might sound stupid, but in zero gravity it actually makes sense. It is easy to pick up but hard to master.\r\n\r\nThis is still work in progress. The final game is expected to be done in early 2015. Zombie Night Terror is a lemmings-like game teeming with hordes of zombies craving for fresh meat.
